# Syllabus

The course covers the following topics:


   * Introduction, RStudio IDE, Syntax (base vs. tidyverse), functions, (base-r) loops, data types (Intermediate: + efficiency and benchmarking)
   * “Telling stories with charts” Visualizations with ggplot2 (theory and practice) (Intermediate TBD we might add one of: gganimate, plotly, leaflet)
   * Basic data import read/write (csv, excel)
   * Introduction to the tidyverse (dplyr, tidyr, tibbles) + Data preparation and transformation
   * Tidyverse continued: exercises + extensions (dates, strings, factors) + Exploratory data analysis, handling outliers
   * Solving business problems with R (Modelling, optimization, classification/regression, ROC)
   * purrr-ing functions (functional programming and iterations with map()) (Intermediate: + make your functions tidyverse friendly - non standard evaluation)
   * Solving business problems with R - part 2: Additional exercises + Modelling extended
   * TBD: Either time series OR RMarkdown OR Dashboards + Summary + Learning more.
