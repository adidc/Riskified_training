## Goals of this exercise

In this exercise you will build a function which computes the Fibonacci series (0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21,...)

WARNING:
This is a **relatively complex** exercise and it's not directly related to data analysis. The reasone I am giving you this exercise is that it is a great exercise to reherse all the elements we were discussing: 
   
   1. Functions and recursion (a function calling itself) 
   2. Base-r loops
   3. Conditionals (`if...else if...else`).
   
```
fibonnachi <- function(n){
  if (n == 0) {
    return(0)
  } else if (n == 1) {
    return(1)
  } else {
    return(fibonnachi(n-1) + fibonnachi(n-2))
  }
}
```
