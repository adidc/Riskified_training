# What for and why now?

When we think about the data science workflow, it makes a lot of sense to start our lesson with tidying data or data transformations, however, I chose to start with visualizations. Why is that?

I'm adopting the approach of the "R for Data Science book", which talks about visualizations in one of its early chapters (even before data transformations), because charts give a lot of motivation to our next chapters and also helps us develop a way of thinking.

As you will see, the following exercises will also contain some elements of tidying and transforming data (because sometimes its a necessity towards working on a chart), but we will not put the emphasis there. In a future lesson we will delve deeper into tidying and data transformations.

**Remember:**
When you do the exercises, if you get stuck, put on a pink sticky note. If I haven't noticed it, call me. If you finished, put up the green one.


This class is comprised of a number of exercises over a number of data sets. According to each group's pace, we will cover the following topics (in order):

   * Planning charts according to the ggplot2 philosophy
   * Basic ggplot2 charts: describing data of various origins and types using charts (factor, numeric, character)
   * Generating maps
   * Generating interactive charts:
      * Why and when should you do that?
      * Generating interactive charts using `plotly`
      * Generating interactive charts using `ggvis`, and describe the main differences between ggvis and ggplot2
   * Generate parametrized RMarkdown files, including adapting charts, with the click of a button (not only visualizations related, but seemed like the right place to talk about it)
   * If time permits we might also reach:
      * Make your charts branded
      * Generating animated charts using `gganimate`
      * Interactive maps using leaflet
      * Understanding what is a shiny app and what is reactive programming

Along the exercise we will have "checkpoints", if you reached a checkpoint put on your green sticky note. You can take a break, dring a soda, or continue to the next exercise. Once I see a lot of green sticky notes we will stop and discuss the exercise up to the checkpoint.
